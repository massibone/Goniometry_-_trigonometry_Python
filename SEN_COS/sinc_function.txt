The sinc function in Python is a mathematical function that returns 
the value of sin(x)/x.

Suppose you have a dataset consisting of frequency values in Hertz 
and corresponding magnitudes. You want to normalize the magnitudes, 
taking into account the frequency response of your measurement system.

You could apply the sinc function to each frequency value to get a 
correction factor, then multiply each magnitude by that factor to normalize 
the data.

For example, if you have a frequency value of 10 Hertz, 
you would calculate the correction factor as:


correction_factor = sinc(10)

If the result of the sinc function is 0, you would set the correction factor 
to 1 to avoid dividing by 0.

You would then multiply the magnitude at 10 Hertz by the correction factor 
to get the normalized magnitude.

Repeat this process for all frequency values in your dataset 
to fully normalize the data.
